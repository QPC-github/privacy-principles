# Web Privacy Model (Principles?) Task Force

## Proposed Charter

The purpose of the Privacy Model Task Force is to bring together a small group of people to write a first draft of a set of a privacy model for the web.  This document would include definitions of key privacy concepts in the web, enabling us to use common language as we work together on new web technologies that have an impact on user privacy.  It woould also consolidate some of the work already done to define a privacy threat model. 

[under question: Privacy is a very complex social construct so we will not seek to fully define privacy in this document.]

This effort will look at privacy from a **web architecture** point of view, fitting together with the TAG's Ethical Principles, Design Principles, and the Privacy & Security Questionnaire jointly worked on between TAG and PiNG.

This effort will operate as a TAG-sponsored task force together with the Privacy Interest Group with participants invited by the TAG chairs and the PiNG chairs (which can include current for former members of each group).  There will a maximum of 10 participants in the task force. The task force will run for 6 months and the final product will be a report which can be published as a TAG Finding (which can be subsequently elevated to a W3C statement) with some additional acknolwedgement that the document has been produced jointly between PiNG and TAG.

This effort will avoid being judgemental and try to remain dispassionate.  However we will be building on the work of the Ethical Web Principles which lays down an ethical framework for the web.  The goal of a privacy model for the web should be aligned with the goal of that document: to ensure that the web provides **a net positive social benefit to humanity**.

Periodically, and before working drafts are published, the task force will check in with an oversight group consistiung of the TAG and PInG chairs and and team contacts for approval and comment.

This effort will happen in a public repo and with public comment.

We will be staying away from legal and regulatory material. 

This effort will operate under the W3C's CEPC and as such we will maintain a respectful discourse. This effort will operate under anti-trust guidance from W3C.

Possible names : Architectural Principles for Web Privacy; Architectural Considerations for Web Privacy.

We will strike a balance between working in the web as it is and also not being constrained by existing approaches if those approaches contravene privacy principles.   

e.g.
> As a target threat model, it describes not the current state of the Web including all current maybe-unwise APIs, but rather an end state that we hope to migrate to, and that new APIs should be held to. This is meant to be a plausible threat model: it doesnâ€™t expect to remove any APIs or browser behavior that is deemed essential to the viability of the Web.
